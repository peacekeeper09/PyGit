Description:
GitHub Profile Viewer is a simple Python application that allows users to retrieve and view essential information from a GitHub profile. The application utilizes the GitHub API to fetch data based on the provided profile link. Upon entering a valid GitHub profile link and clicking the "Fetch Info" button, the application fetches the user's GitHub information, including username, name, bio, the number of public repositories, followers, following, and the GitHub URL. Additionally, it displays the user's avatar in a thumbnail format.
